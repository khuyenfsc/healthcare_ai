# Installation and Setup Guide

## 1. Install Dependencies

First, you need to install all required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

**Run the following command** in the root directory of the project:


pip install -r requirements.txt
This command will automatically install all the libraries required for your project.

## 2. Clone the VietTTS Repository into tts/ Directory
Next, you need to clone the VietTTS repository into a new directory called tts/. The tts/ folder does not exist in your project before this step, so you will need to create it by cloning the repository.

Run the following commands to clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/NTT123/vietTTS.git tts
cd tts
This will clone the VietTTS repository into the tts/ directory and checkout the specific commit f5c5d0956d6ca2bf407011370f75a30dfd536c2f.
